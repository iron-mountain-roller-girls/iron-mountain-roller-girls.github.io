            <p><strong>Bio</strong><br />
                    As the winds howled over the dark and icy wilds of Siberia one freezing winter night, the iron gate of a gulag prison slowly creaked open. Out stepped a man in a dark cloak. He placed a bundle in the snow outside for the wolves. Just hours earlier, Russia&#39;s greatest female boxer, Svetlana Fightmeabitch, gave birth to a child while in prison for punching out the heart of her last opponent. &nbsp;But it was Siberian tiger poachers who found it, and assumed the thrashing, howling bundle was a baby tiger or similarly ferocious creature. They took it with them as stowaways on a ship bound for America, loaded with poached baby tigers and unwittingly, the baby of a Soviet gulag prisoner/female boxer.</p>
            <p>Upon discovering their mistake and who the baby belonged to, they left the wild and unruly baby with a band of renegade roller derby girls deep in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains. As they ran away before the girls could change their minds, the poachers were said to have whispered, &quot;I&#39;ve never seen a baby with such a mean right hook!&quot; raised by the iron mountain roller girls, Shawanna Fightme has in her blood all the stealthy power and unmerciful ferocity of her Russian ancestors. She&#39;s not afraid to go KGB on her opponent by sneaking up behind and taking them out swiftly and silently before anyone even knows what happened.&nbsp;</p>
