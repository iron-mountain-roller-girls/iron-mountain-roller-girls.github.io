<p><strong>Quote</strong><br />
	&ldquo;I am a member of a team, and I rely on the team, I defer to it and sacrifice for it, because the team- not the individual- is the ultimate champion.&rdquo; ~ Mia Hamm</p>
<p><strong>When did you join and why did you start playing derby?</strong><br />
	I joined IMRG in July 2011 as a referee and transitioned this spring to bout skating on the team. My purpose for joining was to push myself to try something new&mdash;little did I know that I would totally fall in love with it!</p>
<p><strong>What keeps you going?</strong><br />
	My husband and daughters are my biggest fans, and seeing them in the crowd or helping out with our team gives me the biggest boost. Also, my teammates keep me going&mdash;my ladies are always there for me, encouraging me to be the best person I can on and off the track.</p>
<p><strong>What&#39;s your favorite thing about your team?</strong><br />
	It is hard to name just one-there are so many things that make IMRG a great team! We are really funny and can make any situation or statement hilarious!</p>
<p><strong>Where do you hope to see your team in 2 years?</strong><br />
	-An official member of WFTDA<br />
	- Known in the derby world for our spirit, sportsmanship and love of the game!</p>
<p><strong>What&#39;s your favorite thing to wear to practice?</strong><br />
	Tank top, shorts, crash pads, and my Animal tall socks (I love the Muppets!)</p>
<p><strong>Type of skates / wheels you use</strong><br />
	Riedell Vixens, Radar Flat Out Wheels 88s</p>
<p><strong>Type of skates / wheels / gear you really, really want</strong><br />
