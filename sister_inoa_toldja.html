                    <strong>When did you join and why did you start playing derby</strong><br />
                    July 2010. I started playing derby because I have always been a fan. From the campy 1970&rsquo;s version of derby to the modern flat track revival, I just have always loved it and wanted to be part of a team.</p>

                    <strong>What keeps you going</strong><br />
                    I have never quit at anything in my life and I&rsquo;m not going to start now. Just reminding myself of that keeps me going, that and the fact that this is something I have always wanted to do so I&rsquo;m not going to stop now that I have the opportunity to do it.</p>

                    <strong>Favorite thing about your team</strong><br />
                    We are very much like a family. There is genuine care and concern among us. We want to see each other succeed. We want out team to succeed.</p>

                    <strong>Quote</strong><br />
                    &ldquo;The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the week through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother&rsquo;s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.&rdquo; &ndash;Ezekiel 25:17</p>

                    <strong>Favorite thing to wear to practice</strong><br />

                    <strong>Type of skates/wheels you use</strong><br />
                    R3 Pinks, and Fugitive Wheels</p>
            <p><br />
                    <strong>Type of skates/wheels/gear you really, really want</strong><br />
                    I already have the gear and wheels I want, I love my 187s and Fugitive Wheels. As far as skates go, I&rsquo;m kind of all over the place. I would like to build my own, but I know that I would probably go broke doing so. I like the Riedell 265 boot, and I definitely want aluminum plates. However, Antiks I&rsquo;ve heard nothing but good things about and they sound great. I think when it&rsquo;s skate update time I&rsquo;m leaning&nbsp; toward something like the Wicked 265 package that they have on Sin City or the Antik MG-2 package on the same site, not necessarily those packages but something similar.</p>

                    <strong>Where do you hope to see your team in two years</strong><br />
                    I hope to see us still going strong. I hope to see us at WFTDA apprentice status. I hope to see us working towards having out own facility. I hope a lot of things for us, the sky really is the limit.<br />
