<p><strong>When did you join?</strong><br />
	March 2011</p>
<p><strong>Why did you join and what keeps you going?</strong><br />
	I have always enjoyed sports and challenges and this meets both of those needs. I keep going because I&rsquo;m competitive, with others and myself. Also, I&rsquo;m in love with derby! How can you not be? It&rsquo;s a great sport with great people.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite thing about derby?</strong><br />
	Not only can I hit people and not get arrested, but hitting is encouraged and reinforced.</p>
<p><strong>Least favorite thing about derby?</strong><br />
	When people find out and say &ldquo;you, play roller derby.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Favorite thing about my team?</strong><br />
	They&rsquo;ve become my family. If I&rsquo;m not with them for practice, doing some event together or just hanging out with them, I&rsquo;m usually telling my bio family and co-workers about practice or an event we just did.</p>
<p><strong>Bio</strong><br />
	My other name is Kristy, I am a counselor (mental health) and mainly work with adolescents and their families. I love my job but it can be high stress, so derby has provided me with a wonderful outlet where I can relieve stress, challenge myself physically, and spend time with probably some of the most wonderful people I&rsquo;ve ever met. Going into derby I didn&rsquo;t know what to expect, especially from the other skaters. In fact I was super intimidated at first, but I can honestly say I have never felt so welcomed by a group than I have with IMRG.</p>
