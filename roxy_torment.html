<p><strong>When did you join and why did you start playing derby?</strong></p>
<p>I joined IMRG in February 2011. One day at work a friend told me about a sign they saw for a roller derby team. I thought it sounded interesting so I went to a fresh meat night, and I fell in Love!</p>
<p><strong>What keeps you going?</strong><br />
	My team really keeps me going (special shout out to The Predicament). We all have the desire to better ourselves and our team.</p>
<p><strong>What&#39;s your favorite thing about your team?</strong><br />
	The friendship, Camaraderie, and the dancing!</p>
<p><strong>Where do you hope to see your team in 2 years?</strong><br />
	At a WFTDA apprentice status, and kicking ass and taking names.</p>
<p><strong>What&#39;s your favorite thing to wear to practice?</strong><br />
	A fun skirt, cute knee-high socks, and a tank top</p>
<p><strong>Type of skates / wheels you use</strong><br />
	White and pink R3&rsquo;s with Sure-Grip sugar wheels</p>
<p><strong>Type of skates / wheels / gear you really, really want</strong><br />
	I really want the 395 Sunlite Fugitive skates in white, with pink Sure-Grip fugitive wheels and grey Sure-Grip pushers. I already love the rest of me gear.</p>
