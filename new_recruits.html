          <hr class="dashed full_hr thin">
          <p>"On behalf of the Iron Mountain Roller Girls, I'd like to welcome you to the world of Roller Derby. It is an exciting, competitive, and athletic sport. If you are a female, 18 years or older and interested in learning how to skate or already have experience, I encourage you to come out to our next Open house, which you will find on our events calendar.</p>
          <p>Please don't use age, experience or size as an excuse. I've seen women as old at 60 join derby teams and excel as well as an 18 year old. Many of the women who start on our team haven't been on skates since they were a child or some never have been at all. Derby is a non discriminatory sport for any size, belief system, sexual orientation or nationality. We at IMRG welcome any girl that is excited about Roller derby and willing to dedicate themselves to our Team!</p>
          <p>I won't sugar coat it for you though, it is a lot of hard work and dedication. We allow 2 free practices for each girl trying out for the team. This is to allow yourself time to feel out roller derby and see if it is something you would be willing to invest in. After that it is 40$ a month and you'll need to purchase all your gear. So come check us out or send me and email with any of your questions."</p>
